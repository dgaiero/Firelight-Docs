# RemteApp instructions

There are two ways to access RemoteApp services. The first of those is through the web interface. The second is by connecting your computer to the server to allow local access to the remoteApps.

## RemoteApp
1. Visit [https://fire-light.us/RDWeb](https://fire-light.us/RDWeb) for access remoteApps.

3. After you login, you will be greeted with a screen of all remoteApps that you have access to.
4. Click on any app that you want to access. A file will download. Click on that file, and then login with the same username as before.
