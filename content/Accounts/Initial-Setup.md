# How to setup your account.

Once an account has been provisioned for you, you should receive an email. If you do not receive an email, please contact [webmaster@fire-light.us](mailto:webmaster@fire-light.us).

The email will look something like the following:

```Text
Dear John,

An account has been made for you on winserver1 on AD network ad.fire-light.us. To finish setup of your account, please visit https://uac.fire-light.us to set your password. To use this site, you must login with your username and domain (AD\jrdoe). Once you login, click reset password, and type your current password, given below and the new password of your choice.

Your initial credentials are:

Domain	Username	Password
AD        jrdoe       @38aeec86115d12e0290f69744521f15318b951b1

Your user folder is available through the UNC path: \\winserver1\NGUsers\jrdoe. You can access this folder directly on any intranet connected computer. If you are on the external network, you will need to use RDP and the gateway server. For more information visit https://docs.fire-light.us/rdp/setup. Your user folder name can be identified by your account ID: jrdoe.

Thank you,

AD
```
